                        I completed this project as part of my Milestone 1 submission for my Code Institue Diploma. I was tasked with creating a simple website using HTML and CSS, that is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices. The site didn't need to have any functioning Javascript, Python or connect with a database of any kind. In order to pass this project I needed to display my undestanding of structing a website using HTML and CSS. I was able to use a CSS framework of my choice, so due to its industry popularity I chose to use Bootstrap. I created this site for a sudo start up company called Re-Tye-Dye, a echo friendly second hand garmet auctioning website. The site needed to connect with Re-Tye-Dye's intended target market, and so the images, colour pallete and overall design aesthetic needed to contiune throughout the site, and connect with that target market. I feel this project displays a basic but strong understanding of using both HTML and CSS to create a simple yet effect site.

                        I completed this project as part of my Milestone 2 submission for my Code Institue Diploma. I was tasked with creating a website, continuing the HTML and CSS skills I had displayed in the previous project. The site needed to be response, accessible and have some interactive elements. To create the interactive elements I needed to use Javascript and incorporate some APIs.

                    <p>
                        This site was created for a small cycling club based in West London. Due to the size of the club the website needed to be simple, one page with various sections displaying key information. Displaying the clubs cycling route is a key feature of the site. In order to display that informatiom in an interactive manor I turned to Googles Directions and Maps Javascript API. The "Join the Crew" section of the site allows the visitor to reach out to the club using an interactive form. I used EmailJS API to achieve this and this feature allows the interested visitor to express interest in joining the club, and would allow the club to effectively manage and increase it's membership.

                        I completed this project as part of my Milestone 3 submission for my Code Institue Diploma. I was tasked with creating a website that displayed the previous skills in my previous projects, but also incorporate Python. The site needed to be response, accessible, interactive and be connected to a database. In order to do this I chose to use Flask as a Python frame work, and connect the site to a MongoDB Database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site was created for a company called "Missing Piece", which offers an online platform to connect UK based rental companies together in order to crosshire and pool their resources. The site displays CRUD operations, allowing users to register an account, amend account information, upload hire stock information to a database and amend or delete that information from said database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although displaying my Python skills was the main requirement of this project, I still needed to have a key design aesthetic running through out for the site . I used a combination of both Bootstrap and Materalize CSS frame works to help achieve this task.

                        I completed this project as a submission for my Milestone 4 project. This final project was the final challenge as part of my Code Institue Diploma. As with the previous projects this project asked me to display all of the previous skills I had learned on the diploma HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, unlike my Missing Piece website that used both a combination of Flask and MongoDB this project required the use of well known python framework Django. The project needed to display CRUD functionality and also allow the user to complete a transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created an eccommerce site for an online tropical terrarium retailer called Glass Jungle. Glass Jungle offers its clients all of the equipment required to create their own planted terrariums at home. The site displays CRUD operations, allows users to register an account, amend account information, rate and comment on product featured on the sites store and upload posts on the "Share Your Builds!" section of the site. The site also allows vistors to purchase items on the site, they can either register an account to do that or not. I turned to Stripe as it is a popular and well used tool for taking care of payment transactions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am extremely proud of this project, as I feel it perfectly displays the skills I have picked up during my diploma. Not only does the site function as I intended, aesthetically I feel it carries a strong indenty that really connects with the Glass Jungles intended target market.

                        Having completed the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development I have acquired a strong set of technical skills to use as foundations in which to grow a successful career as a developer.  However, what is lacking, is experience in working with a development team. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To combat this potential weakness and increase both my team working and team management skills, I am an avid attendee of the Code Institute Hackathons. Each Hackathon has a main topic and a brief relating to that topic. In May of 2022, I took part in the Earth Day Hackathon. On this occasion the brief was relatively open, the only stipulation being to create an application to help inform the user of the impact of climate change, or to provide a tool on how they could help limit the affect they themselves were having on climate change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together with a team of four other developers, in three days we created a website called “The Planeteers. Aimed at young children, the goal was to present useful facts together with a fun game to help educate them on their impact on the climate. Although the tech stack used on this project was relatively simple, the main learning goal was achieved. During the completion of this project, I gained a better understanding of Git, working from branches other than the main one, submitting pull requests and merging pull requests. I also acted as SCRUM master, which allowed me to improve my team management skills. Using Github Projects I was able to ensure communication within the team was constant. This resulted in the team working efficiently and avoiding any stumbling blocks in the form of conflicts.
